# SdeToFit
Java command-line application to convert Suunto SDE dive log files as [exported](https://www.suunto.com/en-us/Support/faq-articles/dm5/how-do-i-import--export-dive-logs-to-dm5/) from Suunto Dive Manager to [ANT](https://www.thisisant.com/) Flexible and Interoperable Data Transport (FIT) format for [import](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/import-data) into Garmin Connect. I wrote this application after switching from a Suunto D3 to a Garmin Descent Mk2 dive computer and wanted to view all of my old logs in one platform. Using it requires downloading the free Garmin [Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer (FIT) SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/fit/overview/); it is not available through a Maven repository and is not open source so I can't redistribute it here.
